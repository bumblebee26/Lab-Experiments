# In this experiment, we have performed Morphological Operations on the images.

The Morphologica operations included are --

1.  Dialation.  (Expands the image object)
2.  Erosion.    (Shrinks the image object)
3.  Opening.    (Erosion followed by Dialation)
4.  Closing.    (Dialtion followed by Erosion)
