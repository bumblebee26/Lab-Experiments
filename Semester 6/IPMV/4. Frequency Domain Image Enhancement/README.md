# In this experiment, we have performed Image Enhancement in Frequency Domain.

The examples of enhancement techniques in frequency domain are --

1.  Low pass Filtering (Smoothing).
    a. Ideal Low pass Filter.
    b. Butterworth Low pass Filter.
    c. Guassian Low pass Filter.
    
2.  High pass Filtering (Sharpening).
    a. Ideal Highpass Filter.
    b. Butterworth High pass Filter.
    c. Guassian High pass Filter.
