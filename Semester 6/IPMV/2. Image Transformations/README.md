# In this experiment, we have performed Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain.
## Image enhancement in Spatial Domain is divided into two parts--

### 1. Point Processing.        
### 2. Neighbourhood Processing.




In this experiment we performed Point Processing on sample images.
The examples of Point processing are--

1.  Digital negative.
2.  Contrast Stretching.
3.  Thresholding.
4.  Gray Level Slicing.
5.  Gray Level Slicing without Background.
6.  Bit Plane Slicing.
7.  Log Transform.
8.  Power Law Transform.
