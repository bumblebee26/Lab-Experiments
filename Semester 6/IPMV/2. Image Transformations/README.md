# In this experiment, we have performed Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain.
### Image enhancement in Spatial Domain is divided into two parts--

## 1. Point Processing.        
## 2. Neighbourhood Processing.




In this experiment we performed Point Processing on sample images.
The examples of Point processing are--

1.  Digital negative.
2.  Thresholding.
3.  Gray Level Slicing.
4.  Gray Level Slicing without Background.
5.  Log Transform.
6.  Power Law Transform.
