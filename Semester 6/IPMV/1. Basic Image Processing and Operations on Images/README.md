### In this experiment, we have performed basic image processing techniques and logical operations on the sample images.
The basic techniques includes-
1. Resizing.
2. Conversion of color image to gray-scale image.
3. Conversion of gray-scale image to binary image.
4. Extraction of Red, Green and Blue layer of the image.
5. Concatenation of RGB layers to form original image.
6. Image Rotation.
7. Image Shearing



The logical operations includes-
1. Addition (by Matlab function 'imadd' and '+').
2. Subtraction (by Matlab function 'imsub' and '-').
3. Logical AND '&'.
4. Logical OR '|'.
5. Logical XOR 'xor'.
6. Logical NOT '~'.
