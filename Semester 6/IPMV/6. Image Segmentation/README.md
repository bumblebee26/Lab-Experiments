# In this experiment, we have performed Image Segmentation.

The Image Segmentation is performed on the basis of boundary of the image objects (Boundary based Segmentation) which includes --

1.  Using single Derivative --
    * Robert's Mask.
    * Prewitt's Mask.
    * Sobel's Mask.

2.  Using double Derivative --
    * Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Mask.
    * Canny Edge Detector.
