# In this experiment, we have performed Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain.
### Image enhancement in Spatial Domain is divided into two parts--

## 1. Point Processing.        
## 2. Neighbourhood Processing.




In this experiment we performed Neighbourhood Processing on sample images.
The examples of Neighbourhood processing are --

1.  Low pass Filtering (Smoothing).
2.  High pass Filtering (Sharpening).
3.  High Boost Filtering.
4.  Median Filtering.
