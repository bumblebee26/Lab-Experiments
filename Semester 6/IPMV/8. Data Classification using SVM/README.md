# In this experiment, we have performed Data Classification using SVM.

* The classification algorithm used is SVM (Support vector Machine). It is a a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression problems. It is a binary classifier. i.e Can classify only two classes at a time.

* The classification problem involves dividing the given data into 2 classes based on their features.

* We use 80% of the data for training and 20% of data for testing.
