# In this experiment, we have performed Image Restoration.

The Image Restoration is performed on the noisy or blurr images to obtain good quality images.

1.  We add noise to the images (convolve) and then deconvolve these images.

2.  The noise models used are --
    * Gaussian Noise.
    * Salt and Pepper Noise.

3.  For Deconvolution we use the following filters --
    * Weiner Filter.
    * Median Filter.
