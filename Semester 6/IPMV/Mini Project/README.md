## Dogs and Cats Classifier using Alex Net convolutional neural networks

We have successfully performed a classification process using Alex Net convolutional neural networks. Although there are many algorithms that perform image classification, convolutional neural network is considered to be a standard image classification technique. Convolutional neural network uses GPU technology because of large number of layers which increases the number of computers. Therefore, we presented a very small convolutional neural network which can work on CPU as well. This network classifies the images into one the two predefined classes say Cat and Dog.
