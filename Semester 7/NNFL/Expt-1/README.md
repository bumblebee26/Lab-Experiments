# In this experiment, we have performed basic fuzzy operations on two Fuzzy sets A and B.
### The basic fuzzy operations are --

## 1. Compliment.        
## 2. Union.
## 3. Intersection.
## 4. De Morgan's Law.
#### a. Compliment(Union of A and B) = Intersection of Compliment(A) and Compliment(B)
#### b. Compliment(Intersection of A and B) = Union of Compliment(A) and Compliment(B)
